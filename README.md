# MicroBooNE_TPCtrigger
A framework to run TPC-based trigger in MicroBooNE

This framework executes a comprehensive sequence of processes for demonstrating TPC-based (data-driven) triggers utilizing MicroBooNE data. It operates online, processing a continuous stream of data gathered during MicroBooNE's R&D phase. The system is characterized by its robustness and speed as a data-driven trigger, specifically designed to identify stopping muons decaying to Michel electrons within the MicroBooNE detector. It efficiently runs a total of 26 processes on a single server, yielding impressive results in both latency and data throughput.
